# Question:
```golang
var users = make(map[string]string)

func createUser(name string) {
    users[name] = time.Now().String()
    }

func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")
    go createUser(name)
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    }
```

# Answer:
The main problem with this code is that the handleRequest function is registered as an HTTP handler, and the HTTP server invokes it concurrently for each incoming request. Inside handleRequest, a goroutine is spawned to call createUser, which modifies the shared users map. Since Go's built-in map is not thread-safe, this leads to a data race when multiple goroutines access and modify the map simultaneously.
Another issue is that the user creation is done asynchronously via a goroutine, but the HTTP handler returns a 200 OK status immediately, without waiting for the creation to complete. This means that if the user creation fails (e.g., due to logic errors or external dependencies), the client wonâ€™t be aware of it. This could cause inconsistencies or reduce system reliability.
