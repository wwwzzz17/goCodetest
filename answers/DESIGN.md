# How would you manage high-concurrency in a Go microservice (thousands of requests per second)?
To handle high concurrency in a Go microservice (thousands of requests per second), I focus on the following principles:
1. Minimize locking and avoid data races by designing the system to reduce shared mutable state.Instead of sharing memory and using mutexes, I prefer message passing through channels where possible. This allows safe communication between goroutines without direct memory sharing.
2. I structure logic to run in parallel using goroutines, with proper limits using worker pools or semaphores to avoid overwhelming the system.
3. I always make use of the request's context.Context to handle cancellations and timeouts—this helps free resources when the client disconnects.

# Recommended project structure for large Go services?
For large Go services, I recommend organizing the project using a layered and modular structure. This typically includes:
1. Separating the program entry point, configuration loading, and build-related files (e.g., Dockerfiles, CI/CD scripts) into their own directories.
2. Dividing the internal business logic (used only within the service) and the external-facing APIs or interfaces into separate modules.
3. Using a layered structure—for example, splitting code into handler, service, and repository layers—to improve maintainability and scalability as the codebase grows.

This kind of structure makes the codebase cleaner, easier to test, and more adaptable to future changes or expansions.
# Approach to configuration management in production?
In production, I manage configuration with the following practices:

1. Separate configurations by environment (e.g., dev, staging, production) to ensure safe and predictable deployments.

2. Use a configuration library (like Viper) to load from files, environment variables, or flags, and support live reload via file watching.

3. For dynamic or centralized configuration, I integrate with a remote config server (such as Consul, Etcd, or a custom service) so services can fetch and update config remotely without redeploying.

This approach allows for flexible, environment-specific, and updatable configuration management in production environments.
# Observability strategy (logging, metrics, tracing)?
For observability, I follow the OpenTelemetry standards to ensure comprehensive tracing, logging, and metrics collection.

From the beginning of each request, I propagate and record a trace ID to enable distributed tracing across services.

I capture the full request lifecycle and record detailed traces, which are then sent to a centralized tracing system.

Logs are structured and include trace IDs for correlation, and are forwarded to a log aggregation platform.

Metrics on request rates, latencies, error rates, and resource usage are collected and exported to systems like Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.

This observability strategy provides a solid data foundation for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
# Go API framework of choice (e.g., Gin, Chi) and why
My preferred Go API framework is Gin, mainly because of its strong community support, rich feature set, and ease of use. It helps developers focus more on business logic rather than framework setup.

Gin provides built-in middleware, good routing capabilities, and better support for parameter binding and validation, which makes it a good fit for business-oriented services or public-facing APIs.

That said, Chi is more lightweight and modular. It’s a great choice for smaller internal services or microservices where performance and simplicity are priorities, and where fewer built-in features are acceptable.
